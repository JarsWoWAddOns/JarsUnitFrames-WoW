# Simple and Lightweight Unitframe. 

This is a small, no-nonsense unitframe replacement. It includes:
* Player
* Target
* Target of Target
* Focus
* Pet

You can adjust:
* Overall Scale
* Font (Including any SharedMediaLib fonts)
* Texture (Including any SharedMediaLib textures)

You can adjust a custom frame width, buff, and debuff disiplays for:
* Target of Target
* Focus
* Pet

This also allows you to auto-mirror the target position. If you select this option, the target frame will mirror the player's frame position along the X axis.

### Configuration

Simply use `/juf` to bring up the configuration screen:

I'll make it look pretty later, I used Claude to hep with the configuration elements so for now I am just making it functional.
