# Simple and Lightweight Unitframe. 

This is a small, no-nonsense unitframe replacement. It includes:
* Player
* Target
* Target of Target
* Focus

You can adjust:
* Overall Scale
* Font (Including any SharedMediaLib fonts)
* Texture (Including any SharedMediaLib textures)

You can adjust a custom frame width, buff, and debuff disiplays for:
* Target of Target
* Focus

### Configuration

Simply use /juf to bring up the configuration screen:

<img width="728" height="856" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1af56de-2c91-4eb4-a03b-209bd81d8ea6" />

I'll make it look pretty later, I used Claude to hep with the configuration elements so for now I am just making it functional.
